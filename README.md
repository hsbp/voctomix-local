HAVOC voctomix configurations
=============================

This git repository contains the local, configuration-specific files used for
voctomix setup(s) at [HAVOC][havoc]. Each directory contains its own `README`
that describes the hardware and software used, along with the actual files
involved. This way, anyone can experiment with the hardware in the hackerspace.
